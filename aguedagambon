# Digital Marketing & Data Analysis | Scaling Startups with Data-Driven Growth

With a degree in Economics and Business Management, I bring 4+ years of experience in digital marketing, strategic communications, and data analysis. Iâ€™ve worked at fast-paced startups like Prontopro and Lori Beds, where I optimized conversion rates (+75%) and scaled growth through A/B testing, CRO, and rebranding. Proficient in web development and design (HTML, CSS, Shopify, Figma), data analysis (Google Analytics, Python, and much more), and paid campaigns (Pinterest, Meta, Google Ads). 

Integrating marketing and data is not only exciting but essential.
